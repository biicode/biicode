* Follow the [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
* Fork the specific repository on GitHub and add the upstream repository.
* Create a feature branch from ``develop`` and start making your changes:

```
$ git checkout -b my-feature-branch -t origin/develop
```

* Check out the README for the information specific to that repository.
* Use git rebase (rather than git merge) to sync your work from time to time.
* Push the change.

```
$ git push origin my-feature-branch
```

* Open a pull request.
* In time we will revise every single PR received. Be patient.


## Individual Contributor License Agreement

Before we can put your code into our codebase, you must sign the Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA). 

We need a CLA because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various other things—for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents.
